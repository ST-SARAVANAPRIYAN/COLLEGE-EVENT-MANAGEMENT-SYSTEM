College Event Management System (CEMS) - Enhanced Project Plan

Overview:
CEMS is a comprehensive platform for organizing, managing, and participating in college events. It supports three user roles: Admin, Organiser, and Participant. The system aims to provide an interactive, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience for all users, with dynamic event pages and robust management features.

Key Features:
1. User Roles:
   - Admin: Manages the entire platform, oversees users and events, handles escalations, and ensures smooth operation.
   - Organiser: Creates and manages events, allocates resources, uploads media (images, videos, brochures), sets event details (timing, venue, fees, capacity), generates reports, analyzes event data with visualizations, updates events, and sends real-time notifications (email).
   - Participant: Registers for events, explores event details, downloads brochures, views event media, pays registration fees (Razorpay integration for dev), and participates in events.

2. Event Management:
   - Events can be Main Events, Sub Events, or Single Events.
   - Main Event cards display sub-events upon click for participants.
   - Organisers can upload exploration website files (HTML, CSS, JS) for each event, which are hosted and accessible via an 'Explore Event' option (opens in a new page).
   - If media (image, video, brochure) is missing, the UI gracefully handles it (e.g., gradient card with event name, fallback video/image, disabled download button).

3. Interactive Event Pages:
   - Event cards adapt their UI based on event tags:
     - Technical events (e.g., hackathons): Neon, tech-inspired UI with dynamic effects.
     - Non-technical events: Fun, colorful UI with playful animations (e.g., animated characters).
   - Clicking an event card dynamically updates the event details section with relevant UI and data.

4. Payment Integration:
   - Razorpay integration for registration fee payments (development mode).

5. Event Exploration:
   - 'Explore Event' option opens a dedicated exploration page (custom HTML/CSS/JS per event if provided by organiser).

6. Organiser Tools:
   - Resource allocation, media uploads, event scheduling, capacity management, venue assignment.
   - Report generation and event analytics with visualizations.
   - Real-time notifications via email.

7. Admin Tools:
   - Full platform management, user and event oversight, analytics dashboard.

8. General UI/UX:
   - Top-notch, responsive, and accessible UI for all pages.
   - Home page, login, signup, and role-based dashboards (participant, organiser, admin).
   - Event lists tailored for each user type.
   - Example/demo data used in frontend for initial development (to be replaced with database integration later).

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: MySQL (to be integrated after frontend demo)
- Payment: Razorpay (dev mode)

Development Plan:
1. Develop the frontend for:
   - Home page
   - Login and Signup pages
   - Event list/dashboard for Participant, Organiser, and Admin
   - Interactive event detail pages (with dynamic UI based on event type)
   - Event exploration page (opens in new tab)
   - Example/demo data for events and users
2. Ensure all UI/UX requirements are met, including responsive design and accessibility.
3. Prepare for backend and database integration after frontend is complete.

---

Start by developing the frontend as described above, using example data for events and users. Once the frontend is ready, proceed to backend and database integration.
